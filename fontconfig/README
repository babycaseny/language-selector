These files go into /etc/fonts/conf.avail/ (debian/install) and should be
linked to /etc/fonts/conf.d/ .

They replace 52-language-selector .

29-language-selector-$lang(-$country)
	* rendering information
	* should be linked by default (debian/rules)
	* excpetion: -zh should NOT linked by default.
	  This the is old configuration from zh_{CN|HK|SG|TW} and has been set
	  already by the fonts-arphic-uming font. If users require these
	  settings for other chinese fonts (which is not recommended, because
	  they don't contain bitmaps), then they can link the file by hand.
30-cjk-aliases
	* should be linked by default
69-language-selector-$lang-$country
	* mutually exclusive
	* depending on which language environment is chosen, one of these gets
	  linked to /etc/fonts/conf.d/ . When the language environment is
	  changed, remove this link first, then link the desired 
	  -$lang-$country file.
99-language-selector-zh
	* artificial emboldening for chinese fonts
	* should be linked by default (debian/rules)
