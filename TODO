* speed:
  - currently _missingTranslationPkgs() is called too often and that means
    and it iterates over the entire cache too often. it should be changed
    so that it only goes over the cache *once* by changing it so that it
    gets a list of translations we are interessted in
* i18n:
  - interface  
  - all language names
* make it more user friendly:
  - add a "preview" when pressing "ok"
  - add some help text at the top of the screen about what
    the system is doing
  - add a message then the system is completed that you
    need to login/logout
